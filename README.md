# covid19
This project builds an epidemiological model step by step and uses it to analyse data and generate predictions.

covidmodels.R - It contains the basic code for building models.

covidfit.R - It contains the code for fitting models to data to constrain model parameters and make predictions.

readdatacovid.R - It contains the code for reading data on covid cases and deaths from a choice of two different data sets into
a data frame.

All the .Rmd files, .html files and .pdf files contain a combination of reports based on illustrative models, fits to data and prognosis.
